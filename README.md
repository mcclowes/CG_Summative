# CG_Summative
Software Methodologies CG Web GL summative assignment
Coursework Description

+ The 3D lecture room should comprise both static and dynamic objects. A static object means its attributes, such as position, orientation, colour, are kept unchanged while your program is running. In contrast, attributes of a dynamic object may change if necessary.
+ In addition, apply texture mapping to enhance the appearance of your work. + Program:
+ Work out your program using WebGL, such that it can run in a Web browser for people visualising a virtual 3D lecture room with its facilities.
+ Construct a virtual camera and proper light source(s), allowing 3D objects and the virtual environment to be visualised properly.
+ Include simple interaction mechanisms (e.g. using hotkeys), allowing a user to examine the 3D environment by changing the orientation or the position of the virtual camera and to induce changes to dynamic objects.

# Assessment:
The assignment will be assessed by the following items, and the level of achievement in each item will be marked against the university's marking criteria:
https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/university.calendar/volumeii/2014.2015/coreregsug.pdf
+ Modeling of static objects (the use of simple shapes, transformation operations and texture mapping) (20%)
+ Modeling of dynamic objects (the use of simple shapes, transformation operations, texture mapping, and interaction mechanisms) (35%)
+ Modeling of the virtual environment (the use of static and dynamic objects, transformation 
operations, scene graph, virtual camera, light source(s), and interaction mechanisms) (20%)
+ Implementation of vertex and fragment shaders (10%)
+ Robustness of the implementation (10%)
+ Extra computer graphics features included [e.g. implement techniques that you have learnt from the lectures but that are not part of the prescribed requirements](5%)

# Deliverables:
+ All program source codes and any necessary files or programming libraries that are required to execute your programs
+ Three different screenshots (in JPEG format) demonstrating good aspects of your implementation
+ A one-page report (in MS word or pdf format) which includes:
+ Description of how you match the coursework requirements and the assessment criteria
+ A list of the limitations of your implementation
+ Description of the attached three different screen shots of your implementation
+ Justification for the extra computer graphics features included in your implementation
+ A list of the public domain packages / source code that you have used in your coursework
